Additional GUI elements:

1) When the game ends, a fancy text appears stating "XYZ Player 
Wins!"

2) I used the following libraries to introduce the sounds:

	import javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream;
	import javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem;
	import javax.sound.sampled.Clip;

	- When player plays a valid hand a specific sound is 
	  produced making the next player vigilant that the player
	  has done its turn
	- When a player plays an invalid turn then another
	  different type of sound is produced
	- When the game ends, a victory sound clip is played.
	  (In case the sound clip is played and player, presses
	   the restart button then I have coded in a way that 
	   sound clip stops!)

3) I used an additional element called JScroll Pane to ensure 
that the text is visible even after the the box is completely 
filled.
